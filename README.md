Build and Start the Services

1. **Build the services** (this ensures that Docker pulls the latest images):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker images and start the containers.

2. **Start the services**:
   After the build completes, you can start the services using:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
